# What is Anzu? 

Anzu is an open source software designed to create communities. Simple, reactive, and performant forums software. 

This repository contains the core backend code and the frontend as a git submodule inside static/frontend. 

While usable in production (we've run it ourselves in [buldar.com](https://buldar.com) quite smoothly for 5 years) this forums platform is in early stages of development, and it may change suddenly, we're finding our way to define a first stable version.

For install previous knowledge about the stack (golang, mongodb, redis) is required to set things up.

## Anzu's stack
- [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language
- [redis](https://redis.io/) (required) for cache
- [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (required)
- [react](https://reactjs.org/) for the webapp

## Installation

### Download dependencies
The first step is to download Go, official binary distributions are available atÂ [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

Now you need to download and configure **MongoDB** and **Redis**. Alternatively you can use remote servers.

### Download the repositories

Download the [core](http://github.com/tryanzu/anzu) in any path.

Initialize the repo submodule, so the [frontend](http://github.com/tryanzu/frontend) is in `static/frontend`.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install the core dependencies with `go build`.

Install the frontend dependencies with `npm install`.


### Configure

Copy the `.env.example` file into `.env` and edit it to meet your local environment configuration.

### Last steps

Building the frontend before getting started is required, to do so, execute `npm install && npm run build` inside `static/frontend` submodule.
Once the frontend is built you can build the backend program with `go build -o anzu` and then execute `./anzu api` to run anzu's http web server.
